# Spring-Boot
Implemented the spring boot project

This is a simple example of how to build a REST API by simply using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.
In this I have not used the database,have taken the static values(hard-coded values).
In this,by writing /topic in the url we get all the values of topics listed in code.
We can update,delete topics using topic id, and can add topics.

By running the application(Maven project) and type this url on POSTMAN or browser- http://localhost:8888/topics
